LA 1: Programming Background

1. This is a word used by a programming language for a specific use.

2. Putting it in a function, method, class, etc.

3. When they want an operation to continue while something is true.

4. Invoking a block of code to run.

5. A value is assigned to a variable so the variable can be used to 
   store the value in memory.

6. String, int (Java)

7. Given a number, check if it is less than 0.  
   If it is less than 0, get the negative of the 
   original negative, which will now be positive.  
   If the number was originally positive, then 
   we don't take any action. Display the number,
   whether or not it has changed.

   This operation is getting the Absolute Value.

8. Answer: x = 2

    I build a Java program to prove my answer:

    public class SimpleCheck {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        
            // declare integer variable and assign value of 3
            int x = 3;

            // declare integer variable and assign the value
            //    that is a computation that uses the x variable
            int y = 2 * x - 4;

            // check if y is less than zero
            if (y > 0) {
            
                // decrement x by 1
                x = x - 1;
            }

            // print the value of x
            System.out.println(x);
        }
    }

9. Answer: f(f(2)) = 14

    I built a Java program to prove my answer:

    public class F_of_X {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            
            // print a line with the result of feeding
            //    2 into the method f,
            //    and then feeding that answer back into the method f
            System.out.println(f(f(2)));
        }

        // method takes integer, does math, returns integer
        public static int f(int x) {
            
            // 3 is multiplied by x, then we subtract 1
            return 3 * x - 1;
        }
    }

10. I used Java to write this program:

    public class DisplayOneThruTen {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            // create an integer variable "x", assign the value of 1
            int x = 1;

            // use while loop to check if x is less than 11
            while (x < 11) {

                // on the same line, print the current value of x followed by a space
                System.out.print(x + " ");

                // increment the value of x by 1
                x++;

            }
        }
    }
