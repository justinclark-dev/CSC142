1. The term for a function which is inside a class is:
        method

2. The official term for a variable declared within a class is:
        wrong(instance variable)
        right( ? )

3. The most typical access modifier for an instance variable is:
        private

4. The most typical access modifier for a method is:
        public

5. The *private* access modifier indicates that there is no access to this resource.
        wrong(True)
        right(False)

6. What is the return type for a method which does not return a value?
        *=void
        * null
        * All methods return values.
        * The place for the return type is left empty.
        * int

7. Give the syntax used to call a method from an unrelated object.  You can use angle brackets < name > to indicate placeholders.  For example, the syntax for an assignment to a variable is: <variable> = <expression>

You can give an example for partial credit.  If include more than just the method call, it will be considered an example and awarded partial credit at best.
        Answer(<class>.<method>)

8. In Java, what must differ between overloaded methods?
    Select all that apply (got some wrong or incomplete)
        * method name
        *?return type
        * parameter names
        *?parameter types
        * method modifiers
        *?number of parameters

9. A constructor in Java is a method that has the same name as the class.
        wrong(True)
        right(False)

10. Give the syntax used to call a constructor from an unrelated object.  You can use angle brackets <name> to indicated placeholders. For example, the syntax for an assignment to a variable is: <variable> = <expression>

You can give an example for partial credit.  If include more than just the constructor call, it will be considered an example and awarded partial credit at best.
        Answer( new <class>() )

11. Like methods, constructors can be overloaded.
        True
