LA11 - Reindeer
Grading: Plus Level

1. private java.util.ArrayList<String> reindeer;

2. reindeer = new ArrayList<String>();

3. app.reindeer = new java.util.LinkedList();

4. No.  There is no difference in the behavior between the 
   ArrayList and the LinkedList.

5. The application added the reindeer names again, now there are 16 
   reindeer names.

6. app.reindeer = new java.util.HashSet<String>();

7. No, there is not yet any difference in behavior between the ArrayList 
   and the HashSet.

8. The List allows duplicates while the Set does not allow duplicates, 
   therefore the names are not added again and the set remains with 8 
   unique reindeer names.

9. /**
    * A simple method to print out the contents of
    * the collection.
    */
    public void print() {
       Iterator<String> collectionIterator = reindeer.iterator();
       while (collectionIterator.hasNext()) {
           System.out.print(collectionIterator.next() + " ");
       }
       System.out.println();
    }
