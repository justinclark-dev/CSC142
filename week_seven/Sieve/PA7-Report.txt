Justin Clark
PA 7: Sieve of Eratosthenes
Grading: Standard Level

*  How did you go about starting this project?

    I started this assignment a little later than normal because I has less 
    time, then I went around in circles trying to figure out how to even get 
    started with the minimal level.  Eventually, after re-reading the 
    instructions multiple times, I finally figured out how to get started.  
    The getPrimes algorithm was a nice challenge, but the hard part initially 
    was just figuring out how MySieve would connect to the SieveDriver.  Once 
    I got that it made much more sense.

* What works and what doesnâ€™t?

    Everything works except for the challenge level item(s).

* What are the test cases you created for this assignment?

* Did these test cases help you verify the correctness of your results?

        Yes, these put my absolute confidence in my algorithm.

* The surprises or problems you encountered while implementing this application

        Besides what I mentioned about starting the project, the biggest problems
        were the issues I solicited your help for with the scanner, and subsequently
        the logic errors encountered when iterating over the scanner input.

* The most important thing(s) you learned from this assignment

        * Slow down, take a deep breath and read the full error message.
        * Sorta solidified my understanding of how the murky scanner works.
        * The ways I can use classes to add functionality without inheritance.
        * How I can inherit an interface and use it as a type.

* What you would do differently next time?

        Not take a difficult class in summer quarter!  My brain is totally overloaded 
        at this point this quarter.  I hope I'll do decently on the final and not 
        burnout before then... I'm almost there.  As far as projects go, there's not
        much I could do differently considering my time constraints these last few
        weeks.

* [Challenge] report the 8 timing values from the Challenge application. Make 
  sure you label the values clearly.
