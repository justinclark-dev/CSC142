LA8: Scanner
Grading: Plus Level

1) What is the advantage of declaring scan as a field, rather than 
   a local variable?

    By declaring scan as field you only need to declare it once,
    then you can use it in multiple methods without needing to 
    redeclare another one. 

2) What does the application do if you press the return key multiple 
   times in response to the prompt "Enter word 0: "?

    Hitting the enter key multiple times simply forces the .next() 
    method to return the console prompt to a new line, and continue 
    waiting for actual input.  It will not proceed further until 
    something gets typed, just another prompt on a new line.

3) What does the application do if you enter two-word values, like 
   "peanut butter", "ice cream", "hot dog", in response to the prompt 
   "Enter word 0: "?
 
    If you enter two-word values, the program creates a token for each 
    word, the first token is returned for the first pass of the loop 
    (word 0), and the second word is returned for the second pass of 
    the loop (word 1).

4) What does the application do if you enter a sentence, like "the 
   quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",  in response to the 
   prompt "Enter word 0: "?

    If you enter a sentence into the program, it only tokenizes the 
    first five words because the loop only cycles five times.  So if 
    you enter: "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", then it 
    will create a token for "the", "quick", "brown", "fox", and "jump".

5) How does the method handle a real number or a non-numeric value?

    The method handles numeric values without issue, however, non-numeric
    values cause a "java.util.InputMismatchException" exception to be
    thrown.
