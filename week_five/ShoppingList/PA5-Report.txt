Grading: Standard Level

*  How did you approach (get started with) this assignment?

    For this assignment I started with the demos and the readings, 
    then I jumped right in and quickly knocked out the minimal level, 
    and then the standard level, and half the challenge level.  The 
    removing part stumped me!  

*  What design decisions were made?

    The rules for this assignment didn't leave much room for making my 
    own design decisions, but one big decision was to put all the 
    validation checks into a single method which made the program much 
    more organized.

*  What works and what doesn't work?

    Everything works except for removing items.

*  What problems did you encounter as you worked on this assignment?

    Staying within the confines of the rules for removing items proved 
    to be quite the formidable task. I had to do a lot more reading 
    and rereading and watching videos on the Scanner class. Ultimately, 
    I could not grasp any way to use only one scanner instance that 
    allowed multiple tokens while also allowing multiple items in a 
    single token.  I think my biggest challenge was just not having 
    enough time to figure it out.

*  What did you learn from this assignment? What would you do 
   differently next time?

    From this assignment I learned that the Scanner class is tremendously 
    more complex to use than using "System.console().readLine()" which I
    use in my study guide program.  I can see how useful the Scanner 
    class could be when parsing a file, but for simple console input it 
    seems to be overkill.  However, for the purpose a challenge level 
    assignment... it definitely provides a great challenge to overcome. 
    I can't wait to see a solution posted to the challenge level!  I 
    don't know of anything I would change next time that would help next 
    time.
