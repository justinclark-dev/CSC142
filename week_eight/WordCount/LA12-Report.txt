Justin Clark
LA 12: Word Count
Grading: Plus Level

1. How does this program know the name of the file to be opened?

        The name of the file is passed to the Java program as a command-line
        argument.

2. The WordCount program will crash if given the name of a non-existent file. 
   What is the unhandled exception that causes the crash?

        The unhandled exception is of type "java.lang.NullPointerException".

3. How can this program be updated to "gracefully" deal with an error in the 
   filename? That is, what modification needs to be made so that it doesn't 
   crash when a "bad filename" is given.

        The tokenCount() method needs to have all the scanning code inside the 
        Try Statement.  Then the Catch Statement needs to provide a user-
        friendly error message.
